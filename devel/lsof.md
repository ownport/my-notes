# lsof

[lsof](http://people.freebsd.org/~abe/) is a command meaning "list open files", which is used in many Unix-like systems to report a list of all open files and the processes that opened them. 

Open files in the system include disk files, pipes, network sockets and devices opened by all processes. One use for this command is when a disk cannot be unmounted because (unspecified) files are in use. The listing of open files can be consulted (suitably filtered if necessary) to identify the process that is using the files.
