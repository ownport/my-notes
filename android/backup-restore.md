# Backups & Restore

## Make a backup 
(extracted from [Samsung Galaxy S: Full Update Guide](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S:_Full_Update_Guide))

Don't forget to back up your data. If you have synced the device with a Google account, then the contacts, calendar, Gmail, & select other Google-related data will not be lost and will come back after the next sync. However, you should backup anything you want to keep that is not stored on the SD card:

SMS/MMS messages,
Call Log,
Bookmarks,
Applications; use [Titanium Backup](http://market.android.com/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup) or the [Astro File Manager](http://market.android.com/details?id=com.metago.astro), for example,
Any application data not on the SD card.

It would also be a good idea to backup everything stored on the SD card in the rare case the SD card must be formatted to resolve any major problems.

[MyBackup Root](http://market.android.com/details?id=com.rerware.android.MyBackupRoot), [SMS Backup & Restore](http://market.android.com/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore), and [Call Backup & Restore](http://market.android.com/details?id=com.riteshsahu.CallLogBackupRestore) are all free applications that can assist with backing up your data.
